# Stock-Prediction

Predicting an airline’s stock price based on on-time performance and twitter sentimentanalysis.

We are trying to understand if there is a hidden trend on how stock prices of an airlinecompany,American Airlines, 
are affected by it’s on-time performance and customersatisfaction.

Suppose, on a particular day, if majority of flights of a particular airline company arecancelled/delayed 
(as it had occurred in case of delta airlines recently, link), it can be intuitively understood that this
would affect the company’s stock prices.  A drop in thestock prices could be anticipated.

However, this trend in stock prices may not be effectively predicted on regular days.  We were intrigued 
by this idea as there might be a hidden trend in nature which may notbe intuitive to understand, but Machine Learning 
ideas could be used in this scenario tolearn a close approximation of this hidden trend.
